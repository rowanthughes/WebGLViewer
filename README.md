Tiny stand-alone Three.js viewer for testing or just a jump-off point for experiments.

Caters for .glb/.gltf out of the box as well as having a few pre-defined shaders and mesh helpers. I have hopefully constructed things so you can extend these features with ease.

To install:
npm install

To run:
npm run dev

Have fun! (I am not a JS dev so please forgive my sins!)
